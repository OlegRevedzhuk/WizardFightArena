This personal project is my attempt to make a fully functioning and interractive desktop application using Unity. Through this project I aim to show my ability to understand and use code generated by other people. Learning how to use Unity has been an exciting experience, and having all those tools available makes creating a bigger project much easier.

The challenge I ran into with this project is setting up a system that keeps track of the players and allows them to interract. I am currently planning out how to handle connecting players to the game and figuring out how the game will decide where each player begins.

Overall the systems that are currently working are camera controls and character movement, some animations for movements and spell effects, and several different attack and utility spells. I envision a good amount more content in terms of spells in the future, but for now I am focusing on finishing the systems that allow the game to run.
